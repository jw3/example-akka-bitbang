Example Bit Banging from Arduino to Pi
-

An example project to give pigpio-scala a workout and to plan around with bit banging data from an arduino to a pi.

Use pigpio to read the pin state changes with timestamp.

Use Akka Streams to translate from GpioAlerts to a serial bit representation.

#### Serial specs
* Baud 9600
* 2 Stop bits
